Life will always undervalue you if you let it.

Nobody's a hundred percent of any one thing.

# 05-02

Get busy living, Or get busy dying.

A strong man can save himself, a great man can save another.

Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.

Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.

People should't brood around their past.

# 05-04

A strong man can save himself, a great man can save another.

# 05-05

Get busy living, Or get busy dying.

# 05-06

Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free.

# 05-07

You know some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are just too bright.

# 05-08

Miracles happen every day.

# 05-09

Death is just a part of life, something we’re all destined to do.

# 05-10

Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance.

# 05-11

I’m only brave when I have to be. Being brave doesn’t mean you go looking for trouble.

You can’t change the past.

# 05-12

There should be a better way to start a day than waking up every morning.

# 05-13

I don't know  what's worse: to not know what you are and behappy, or to become what you've always wanted to be, and feel alone.

I am afraid. Not of life, or death, or nothingness, but of wasting it as if I had never been.

# 05-14

I figure life is a gift and I don’t intend on wasting it. You never know what hand you’re going to get dealt next. You learn to take life as it comes at you.

# 05-15

You’re throwing away happiness with both hands. And reaching out for something that will never make you happy.

All life is a game of luck.

# 05-16

I don’t want to be someone that you’re settling for. I don’t want to be someone that anyone settles for.

# 05-17

Whatever comes, I’ll love you, just as I do now. Until I die.

I think it’s hard winning a war with words.

# 05-18

Destiny takes a hand.

# 05-19

Every ending is a new beginning.

You don't always have to fight to win.

# 05-20

I'll always love you, no matter where I am.
